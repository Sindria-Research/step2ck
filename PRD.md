# Step 2 CK AI Study Platform — Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 0. Overview

**Product Name (working):** ClinReason AI
**Category:** High-stakes exam performance optimization
**Primary Market:** USMLE Step 2 CK preparation
**Users:** Medical students, IMGs, retakers
**Business Type:** Paid study platform (subscription + premium features)

This product is a **clinical reasoning + performance optimization system**, not just a question bank.
The goal is to help users:

* Achieve higher Step 2 CK scores
* Reach specialty-specific targets
* Study more efficiently using AI
* Retain clinical knowledge long-term
* Build decision-making skills under uncertainty

The product competes with question banks but differentiates via:

* AI reasoning explanations
* predictive analytics
* personalized study optimization
* case-based learning instead of MCQ-first

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Current prep tools fail at:

1. Passive learning

   * Students read explanations instead of thinking clinically

2. Poor personalization

   * No clear answer to “what should I study next?”

3. Weak score prediction

   * Users don’t know readiness

4. No clinical reasoning training

   * Memorization > decision-making

5. Burnout + fatigue

   * No endurance training

6. Fragmented workflow

   * Students use:

     * question banks
     * flashcards
     * planners
     * videos
     * practice exams

**Opportunity:**
Create an integrated AI-first system that replaces planning, improves reasoning, and augments question bank prep.
